= Spring Boot Micro Services Status

This project discovers your app instances through eureka and notify their statuses using slack.

== Stack

The stack is quite simple:

* Java 8
* Spring-Boot 1.2.5.RELEASE

== Micro services architecture

You migrate a big monolithic app to a micro services architecture. You use spring-cloud netfilx stack and the eureka service.
You should use the poop-reporter to be notified when an app status changes.

== Why poop-reporter?

You dealt with a big monolith app. Let's call it a big poop.
Now, with a micro services architecture, you have to deal with a lot of apps - a lot of poops.

TODO: add image to illustrate the concept

== Configuration

TODO: add configuration details

== Usage

Just run the spring-boot app using `mvn spring-boot:run` or the `PoopReporterApp#main` method.
